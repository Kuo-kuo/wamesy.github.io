			<h1>Cyberbulls!</h1>
		<p>When we upload cows to the internet, obviously, we get cybercows. If you did not know this, then you should probably go back to elementary school.</p>
		<p>Less obvious is the fact that there are male and female cows. If you were not aware of this, then I recommend taking <a href="https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/BIOL552">Cowology 101</a>.</p>
		<p>In late 2017, I visited the German Cow Station (GCS) and met a class 3-Heimholtz-ψ cow-monk, who gave me the following information after I bribed her with two (2) kilograms of gluten-free marshmallows. A recent expedition to Canada uncovered some long-forgotten biology lore, detailing how male cows (the ones with testicles (don't touch the testicles)) are called "bulls." If you have a bull and need to give it a name, I recommend "Moobert."</p>
		<p>Consequently, we can see that a bull that has been uploaded to the internet would be called a "cyberbull." Contrary to popular belief, cyberbulls are not dangerous. However, cyberbulls often attempt to send hate mail to cyberhogs. If you stumble upon a cyberbull that is attempting to do so, it is best to back away slowly while chanting the Litany of Cybercreature Acceptance in a low, monotone voice. Honestly nobody wants to deal with a cyberbull if it's sending hate mail to cyberhogs, and it's a huge waste of the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">United States Postal Service's</a> time.
