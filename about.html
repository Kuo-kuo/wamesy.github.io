		<h1>About</h1>
			This website was made by The Human-Internet Cow Coalition (THICC). Since its founding in 2003, THICC has overseen relations between humans and internet cows in order to facilitate positive relations between the two species. By the time THICC acquired Bovines On the Internet (BOI) in 2011, relations between internet cows, by then widely known as cybercows, and humans, were largely stable, with the exception of relations between humand and testicle-possessing cybercows. As such, shortly after the THICC-BOI acquisition, this website was created.
